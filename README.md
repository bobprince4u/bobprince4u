o-Do List App

- Create a simple to-do list app that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
- Use HTML to structure the layout, CSS to style the design, and JavaScript to add interactivity

This JavaScript code selects the necessary HTML elements, adds event listeners to the buttons, and defines functions to add and delete tasks.
